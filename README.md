# Principal-Component-Analysis-of-nutritional-dataset

I conducted a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on a dataset of nutritional information for various food items. I standardized the data, retained components explaining at least 80% of variance, and interpreted the first two components. I identified univariate and multivariate outliers and investigated multivariate normality. Finally, I created a 3-d scatter plot to visualize the data and outliers.

Information of the dataset:
For each food item, there are 7 variables: fat (grams), food.energy (calories), carbohydrates (grams),
protein (grams), cholesterol (milligrams), weight (grams), and saturated.fat (grams).
